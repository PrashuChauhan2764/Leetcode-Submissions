### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true`* if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
```

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.

	- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

	- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
